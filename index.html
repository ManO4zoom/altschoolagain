    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is MarkDavid Ezeh, and I am an enthusiastic and dedicated
        learner with a strong passion for technology and cloud engineering. I
        hold a degree in Quantity Surveying from Yale University, where I
        developed a foundational understanding of computer science and
        networking. Over the years, I have gained practical experience in
        various IT roles, which has fueled my desire to specialize in cloud
        engineering. <br> In my previous roles, I have worked as a cybersecurity expert at
        Gomycode, where I was responsible for managing and deploying IT
        infrastructure, troubleshooting network issues, and ensuring system
        security. These experiences have given me a solid grounding in IT
        operations and have inspired me to delve deeper into the cloud computing
        domain.</p>
